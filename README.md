# Coup
Earned the 21st Century Learning Foundation Scholarship for designing a program to play a bluffing game called Coup.

Overview:

I wrote this program in 2018 when I was first learning how to code. It allows a user to play a game called Coup against a computer, or watch the computer play against itself. If you are unfamiliar with the game, you can request instructions at any time while playing. I began this program as a side project during my AP Computer Science Principles class because my friends and I were having a lot of fun playing this game, and I wanted to practice more to test different strategies and starting conditions in the game. I did not invent this game, but this program is original and of my own design

I collaborated with Liam Multhaup for a small part of the debugging process.
